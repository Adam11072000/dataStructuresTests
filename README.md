# dataStructuresTests
Welcome Students!

generate_tests and generate_outputs are created by me, the test runner run_tests.py is not made by me!

steps to run tests:
  1) download directory into your main directory on your local computer/sharat.
  2) make sure the variable MY_EXEC is the path to your exec file.
  3) run this command on th sharat: python3 run_tests.py
  4) if all is okay then valgrind and diff is okay.
